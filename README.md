## git-replace-branch

This tool is written for github users who use an automated tool (such as
Doxygen) to generate documentation, and then publish the documentation on
github.io using a different branch on the same repository.

It is designed to automate the problem described
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/q/41113325/391161) without the need for
multiple clones.

The tool is entirely encapsulated in the file `git-replace-branch`, and the
purpose of this repository to merely to demonstrate its use.
